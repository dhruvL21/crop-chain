## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Node.js (v18 or later) and npm installed.

### 1. Set up Environment Variables

This project uses Google's Generative AI. To access the AI features, you'll need an API key.

1.  Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`.
2.  Open the new `.env` file.
3.  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini API key. You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

From the project's root directory, run the following command to install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Servers

This project requires two separate processes to run simultaneously. You will need to open two terminals.

**In your first terminal, start the Next.js web application:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:9002`.

**In your second terminal, start the Genkit AI server:**
```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```
This starts the AI service and its inspection UI, which you can view at `http://localhost:4000`.
